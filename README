How to Creating Docker Kodi.proxy/9now container

Place 3 files, Dockerfile, entrypoint.py and plugin.py in the same directory
From that directory run:
> docker build --no-cache -t kodi-proxy:latest .


Modify docker-compose-yml to provide the data path on your local drive.

To run your new docker based Channel 9 playlist:
> docker compose up -d

9Now initial setup:
You need to run some commands inside the docker container 
> docker exec -it kodi-proxy bash

Now run the setup:
kodi.proxy> python proxy.py

Use these entry selections:
	3:plugin - 1: slyguy.9now - 0: Login
    		Goto 9now.com.au/activate and enter the code shown
	when activated
		8: settings - 1: Add-on - 0: Region (select your region)
	enter <ctrl>C to exit the menu.

Exit from the docker container and restart the container to pickup the new changes
kodi.proxy> exit
> docker compose restart kodi-proxy

Test the server using a browser, go to <IP Address>:8181/playlist.m3u8 and you should download a valid playlist.m3u8

FOR TiviMate setup
In settings
set TIVIMate playlist to <IP Address>:8181/playlist.m3u8
To get the playlist for there channels set the TIVIMate playlist epg to Matt's epg.
